An ERC20 token is a smart contract with code that respects the ERC20 standard. Practically, this means that the functions of the smart contract respect the interface defined in the ERC20 standard.

If we want to understand the ERC20 standard, we need to have a look at the function interfaces defined inside.

There is a group of functions that defines the metadata of smart contracts such as:

- name
- symbol
- decimals

Anyone can call these functions. The smart contract will answer with the relevant information.

Besides storing tokens, an ERC20 token must also be able to transfer tokens. There are 2 functions in the ERC20 standards for that:

- transfer
- transferFrom

Why do we need 2 functions and not just one?

The first function allows the owner of a token (identified by his/her Ethereum address) to transfer tokens to another Ethereum address. The cryptographic system of the Ethereum blockchain will ensure that the rightful owner of the tokens triggered the function.

The second function allows a third-party Ethereum address to do a token transfer on behalf of the actual owner of the coin. This is very similar to credit cards where merchants can be allowed to debit credit cards on behalf of their owner.  The big difference is that in the case of ERC20 tokens, we only allow a third party to spend a specific amount of tokens, but not a potentially large or unlimited amount, like for credit cards.

The full process of third-party payment involves 2 steps:

- First, the owner of tokens approves a third-party to spend a token amount on his/her behalf;
- Then, the approved third-party can spend up to this token amount. These tokens can be sent to any Ethereum address.


Here is a short description of the different standard tokens:

ERC20 	: Standard fungible token 
ERC721 	: Standard non-fungible token 
ERC223	: Standard fungible token that can not be lost when sent to wallets or other smart contracts
ERC777	: Standard non-fungible token that can not be lost when sent to wallets or other smart contracts
ERC721x	: Standard non-fungible token that can not be lost when sent to wallets or other smart contracts with cost optimization
